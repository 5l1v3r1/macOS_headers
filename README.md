This repository is a class dump of *most* Apple Applications and Frameworks on macOS. This could be useful to someone for learning/reversing a program or writing a [mySIMBL](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL) plugin.

Included in this repository are dumps of binaries found in:
- `/Applications`
- `/Applications/Utilities`
- `/System/Library/Frameworks`
- `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks`
- `/System/Library/CoreServices`
- `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications`

This can also be used to check what has been updated between releases.

The log folder contains log files with a list of all items that had a different build number in that build.
The tools folder contains some bash scripts used to automate quickly dumping the system.
